# Core-Level Spectroscopy Tools

A collection of scripts to aid in automating the processs of calculating both XPS and NEXAFS spectra for organic molecules adsorbed on metal surface systems using the electronic software package CASTEP. These tools cover the whole process from start to finish, creating all the necessary input files, to all the post processing required and outputting the finished simulated spectra.
